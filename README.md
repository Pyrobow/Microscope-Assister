# Microscope-Assister
A generator to assist people (mainly GMs) with using the Microscope RPG. Written in Python.

Ever wanted to use the Microscope rpg for world building but don't want your players to know the entire History of the world. Well, you're in luck. This program is designed to provide a basic outline of events, which you can then flesh out for yourself.  

Currently it is quite barebones and just runs in command line. In the future it will have a proper user interface.

You still need the rules of Microscope to use this effectively, it is only designed to be an aid.
